# Tutorial

Okay so, a folder (on startup for the first time) should be made in **Bomb Rush Cyberfunk_Data/StreamingAssets/Mods/BombRushSFX/SFX/**, this is where you put all your sfx.

I like to organize in folders, but you don't have to.

## Step 1

Get your audio files.

### Supported Formats
- AIF(F)
- IT
- MOD
- MP2
- MP3
- OGG
- S3M
- WAV
- XM
- FLAC

And put them in that folder.

I'm going to replace red's jumping voice.

## Step 2

Create a new text file, it can be named anything.

Now go into this [file](https://github.com/Kade-github/BombRushSFX/blob/main/IDS.md), and find what collection you want to replace. For voices, it'll be prefixed with "Voice"

Mine would be "VoiceMetalHead"

Which is ID **44**
